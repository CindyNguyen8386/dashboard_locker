# E - Logistics Dashboard
This dashboard displays key KPIs and detailed information to help the operations team monitor the status of green box storage for high-value orders at the e-logistics company
The e-logistics company launched a new value order service, but initial challenges in operations and tracking arose. This dashboard supports the operations team in monitoring key metrics, resolving issues faster, and ensuring 100% accurate HUB implementation to deliver optimal service to customers. 

**Main logic:** Order Flow for Value Orders (High Value / Fragile / Boxed):

**Seller/Customer registers order on system**

→ Order flagged as special (high value, fragile, boxed)

→ Assigned to green box for handling

→ System auto-checks order based on predefined logic

❌ If incorrect ( based on data )→ Alert sent to operations team

→ Operations team reviews and fixes the issue ASAP

**→ Goal: Ensure all value orders follow the correct process 100% at HUB**
